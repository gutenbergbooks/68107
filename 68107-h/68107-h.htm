<p>Jerry Foster told the bartender
that nobody loved him. The bartender,
with the experience of his
trade, said that Jerry was mistaken, and how
about another drink.</p>

<p>“Why not?” said the unhappy Mr. Foster,
examining the scanty contents of his wallet.
“ ‘I’ll take the daughter of the vine to spouse.
Nor heed the music of a distant drum.’ That’s
Omar.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” the bartender said surprisingly.
“But you want to look out you don’t go out
by the same door that in you went. No
brawls allowed here. This isn’t East Fifth,
chum.”</p>

<p>“You may call me chum,” Foster said, reverting
to the main topic, “but you don’t
mean it. I’m nobody’s pal. Nobody loves
me.”</p>

<p>“What about that babe you brought in last
night?”</p>

<p>Foster tested his drink. He was a good-looking,
youngish man with slick blond hair
and a rather hazy expression in his blue
eyes.</p>

<p>“Betty?” he murmured. “Well, the fact is,
a while ago I was down at the Tom-Tom
with Betty and this redhead came along. So
I ditched Betty. Then the redhead iced me.
Now I’m lonely, and everyone hates me.”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t of ditched Betty, maybe,”
the bartender suggested.</p>

<p>“I’m fickle,” Foster said, tears springing
to his eyes. “I can’t help it. Women are my
downfall. Gimme another drink and tell me
your name.”</p>

<p>“Austin.”</p>

<p>“Austin. Well, Austin, I’m nearly in trouble.
Did you notice who won the fifth at
Santa Anita yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Pig’s Trotters, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Foster said, “but I laid my dough
right on the nose of White Flash. That’s why
I’m here. Sammy comes around to this joint
now, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>“I’m lucky,” Foster said. “I got the money
to pay him. Sammy is a hard man when
you don’t pay off.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t know,” the bartender said.
“Excuse me.”</p>

<p>He moved off to take care of a couple of
vodka collinses.</p>

<p>“So you hate me too,” Foster said, and,
picking up his drink, wandered away from
the bar.</p>

<p>He was surprised to see Betty sitting alone
in a booth, watching him. But he was not
at all surprised to see that her blond hair,
her limpid eyes, her pink-and-white skin
had lost all attraction for him. She bored
him. Also, she was going to make a nuisance
of herself.</p>

<p>Foster ignored the girl and went further
back, to where a bulky oblong object was
glowing in polychromatic colors against the
far wall. It was what the manufacturers
insist on terming an automatic phonograph,
in spite of the more aptly descriptive word
juke-box.</p>

<p>This was a lovely juke-box. It had lots of
lights and colors. Moreover, it wasn’t watching
Foster, and it kept its mouth shut.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>Foster draped himself over the juke-box
and patted its sleek sides.</p>

<p>“You’re my girl,” he announced. “You’re
beautiful. I love you madly, do you hear?
Madly.”</p>

<p>He could feel Betty’s gaze on his back. He
swigged his drink and smoothed the juke-box’s
flanks, glibly protesting his sudden
affection for the object. Once he glanced
around. Betty was starting to get up.</p>

<p>Foster hastily found a nickel in his pocket
and slipped it into the coin-lever, but before
he could push it in, a stocky, dark man
wearing horn-rimmed glasses entered the
bar, nodded at Foster, and moved quickly to
a booth where a fat person in tweeds was
sitting. There was a short consultation, during
which money changed hands, and the
stocky man made a note in a small book he
brought from his pocket.</p>

<p>Foster took out his wallet. He had had
trouble with Sammy before, and wanted no
more. The bookie was insistent on his pound
of flesh. Foster counted his money, blinked,
and counted it again, while his stomach fell
several feet. Either he had been short-changed,
or he had lost some dough. He was
short.</p>

<p>Sammy wouldn’t like that.</p>

<p>Forcing his fogged brain to think, Foster
wondered how he could gain time. Sammy
had already seen him. If he could duck out
the back.</p>

<p>It had become altogether too silent in the
bar. He needed noise to cover his movements.
He saw the nickel in the juke-box’s
coin-lever and hastily pushed it in.</p>

<p>Money began to spew out of the coin return
slot.</p>

<p>Foster got his hat under the slot almost
instantly. Quarters, dimes, and nickels popped
out in a never-ending stream. The juke-box
broke into song. A needle scratched
over the black disc. The torchy mourning of
“My Man” came out sadly. It covered the
tinkling of the coins as they filled Foster’s
hat.</p>

<p>After a while the money stopped coming
out of the juke-box. Foster stood there,
thanking his personal gods, as he saw Sammy
moving toward him. The bookie glanced at
Foster’s hat and blinked.</p>

<p>“Hi, Jerry. What gives?”</p>

<p>“I hit a jackpot,” Foster said.</p>

<p>“Not on the juke-box!”</p>

<p>“No, down at the Onyx,” Foster said,
naming a private club several blocks away.
“Haven’t had a chance to get these changed
into bills yet. Want to help me out?”</p>

<p>“I’m no cash register,” Sammy said. “I’ll
take mine in green.”</p>

<p>The juke-box stopped playing “My Man”
and broke into “Always.” Foster put his
jingling hat on top of the phonograph and
counted out bills. He didn’t have enough,
but he made the balance up out of quarters
he fished from the hat.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” Sammy said. “Too bad your
nag didn’t make it.”</p>

<p>“ ‘<i>With a love that’s true, always</i>—’ ” the
juke-box sang fervently.</p>

<p>“Can’t be helped,” Foster said. “Maybe
next time I’ll hit ’em.”</p>

<p>“Want anything on Oaklawn?”</p>

<p>“ ‘<i>When the things you’ve planned, need a
helping hand</i>—’ ”</p>

<p>Foster had been leaning on the juke-box.
On the last two words, a tingling little shock
raced through him. Those particular two
words jumped out of nothing, impinged on
the surface of his brain, and sank in indelibly,
like the stamp of a die. He couldn’t
hear anything else. They echoed and re-echoed.</p>

<p>“Uh—helping hand,” he said hazily. “Helping—”</p>

<p>“A sleeper?” Sammy said. “Okay, Helping
Hand in the third, at Oaklawn. The usual?”</p>

<p>The room started to turn around. Foster
managed to nod. After a time he discovered
that Sammy was gone. He saw his drink on
the juke-box, next to his hat, and swallowed
the cool liquid in three quick gulps. Then he
bent and stared into the cryptic innards of
the automatic phonograph.</p>

<p>“It can’t be,” he whispered. “I’m drunk.
But not drunk enough. I need another shot.”</p>

<p>A quarter rolled out of the coin-return slot,
and Foster automatically caught it.</p>

<p>“No!” he gulped. “Oh-h-h!” He stuffed his
pockets with the booty from the hat, held on
to his glass with the grip of a drowning man,
and went toward the bar. On the way he
felt someone touch his sleeve.</p>

<p>“Jerry,” Betty said. “Please.”</p>

<p>He ignored her. He went on to the bar and
ordered another drink.</p>

<p>“Look, Austin,” he said. “That juke-box
you got back there. Is it working all right?”</p>

<p>Austin squeezed a lime. He didn’t look up.</p>

<p>“I don’t hear any complaints.”</p>

<p>“But—”</p>

<p>Austin slid a replenished glass toward
Foster.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” he said, and went to the
other end of the bar.</p>

<p>Foster stole a look at the juke-box. It sat
against the wall glowing enigmatically.</p>

<p>“I don’t exactly know what to think,” he
said to no one in particular.</p>

<p>A record started playing. The juke-box
sang throatily:</p>

<p>“ ‘<i>Leave us face it, we’re in love....</i>’ ”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>The truth was, Jerry Foster was feeling
pretty low in those days. He was essentially
a reactionary, so it was a mistake for
him to have been born in an era of great
change. He needed the feel of solid ground
under his feet. And the ground wasn’t so
solid any more, what with the newspaper
headlines and new patterns for living emerging
out of the vast technological and sociological
changes the mid-Twentieth Century
offered.</p>

<p>You’ve got to be elastic to survive in a
changing culture. Back in the stable Twenties,
Foster would have got along beautifully,
but now, in a word, he just wasn’t on the
ball. A man like that seeks stable security
as his ultimo, and security seemed to have
vanished.</p>

<p>The result was that Jerry Foster found
himself out of a job, badly in debt, and drinking
far more than he should have done. The
only real advantage to that set-up was that
alcohol buffered Foster’s incredulity when
he encountered the affectionate juke-box.</p>

<p>Not that he remembered it the next morning.
He didn’t recall what had happened for
a couple of days, till Sammy looked him up
and gave him nine hundred dollars, the result
of Helping Hand coming in under the wire at
Oaklawn. The long shot had paid off surprisingly.</p>

<p>Foster instantly went on a binge, finding
himself eventually at a downtown bar he
recognized. Austin was off duty, however, and
Betty wasn’t present tonight. So Foster,
tanked to the gills, leaned his elbow on polished
mahogany and stared around. Toward
the back was the juke-box. He blinked at
it, trying to remember.</p>

<p>The juke-box began to play “I’ll Remember
April.” The whirling confusion of insobriety
focused down to a small, clear, cold
spot in Foster’s brain. He started to tingle.
His mouth formed words:</p>

<p>“Remember April—Remember April?”</p>

<p>“All right!” said a fat, unshaven, untidy
man standing next to him. “I heard you!
I’ll—What did you say?”</p>

<p>“Remember April,” Foster muttered, quite
automatically. The fat man spilled his drink.</p>

<p>“It isn’t! It’s March!”</p>

<p>Foster peered around dimly in search of
a calendar.</p>

<p>“It’s April third,” he affirmed presently.
“Why?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to get back, then,” said the fat
man in desperation. He scrubbed at his sagging
cheeks. “April already! How long have
I been tight? You don’t know? It’s your
business to know. April! One more drink,
then.” He summoned the bartender.</p>

<p>He was interrupted by the sudden appearance
of a man with a hatchet. Foster, blearily
eying the apparition, almost decided to get
out in search of a quieter gin-mill. This
new figure, bursting in from the street, was
a skinny blond man with wild eyes and the
shakes. Before anyone could stop him, he
had rushed the length of the room and lifted
his hatchet threateningly above the juke-box.</p>

<p>“I can’t stand it!” he cried hysterically.
“You spiteful little—I’ll fix you before you
fix me!”</p>

<p>So saying, and ignoring the purposeful approach
of the bartender, the blond man
brought down his hatchet heavily on the
juke-box. There was a blue crackle of flame,
a tearing noise, and the blond man collapsed
without a sound.</p>

<p>Foster stayed where he was. There was a
bottle on the bar near him, and he captured
it. Rather dimly, he realized what was happening.
An ambulance was summoned. A
doctor said the blond man had been painfully
shocked, but was still alive. The juke-box
had a smashed panel, but appeared uninjured
otherwise. Austin came from somewhere and
poured himself a shot from under the bar.</p>

<p>“ ‘Each man kills the thing he loves,’ ” Austin
said to Foster. “You’re the guy who was
quoting Omar at me the other night, aren’t
you?”</p>

<p>“What?” Foster said.</p>

<p>Austin nodded at the motionless figure being
loaded on a stretcher.</p>

<p>“Funny business. That fella used to come
in all the time just to play the juke-box. He
was in love with the thing. Sat here by the
hour listening to it. Course, when I say he
was in love with it, I’m merely using a figure
of speech, catch?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” Foster said.</p>

<p>“Then a couple of days ago he blows up.
Crazy as a loon. I come in and find the guy
on his knees in front of the juke-box, begging
it to forgive him for something or other.
I don’t get it. Some people shouldn’t drink,
I guess. What’s yours?”</p>

<p>“The same,” Foster said, watching the ambulance
men carry the stretcher out of the
bar.</p>

<p>“Just mild electric shock,” an intern said.
“He’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>The juke-box clicked, and a new record
swung across. Something must have gone
wrong with the amplification, for the song
bellowed out with deafening intensity.</p>

<p>“ ‘Chlo-eee!’ ” screamed the juke-box urgently.
“ ‘<i>Chlo-eeee!</i>’ ”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>Deafened, fighting the feeling that this
was hallucination, Foster found himself
beside the juke-box. He clung to it against
the mad billows of sound. He shook it, and
the roaring subsided.</p>

<p>“ ‘Chlo-eee!’ ” the juke-box sang softly
and sweetly.</p>

<p>There was confusion nearby, but Foster
ignored it. He had been struck by an idea.
He peered into the phonograph’s innards
through the glass pane. The record was
slowing now, and as the needle lifted Foster
could read the title on the circular label.</p>

<p>It said, “Springtime in the Rockies.”</p>

<p>The record hastily lifted itself and swung
back to concealment among the others in
the rack. Another black disc moved over under
the needle. It was “Twilight in Turkey.”</p>

<p>But what the juke-box played, with great
expression, was: “We’ll Always Be Sweethearts.”</p>

<p>After a while the confusion died down.
Austin came over, examined the phonograph,
and made a note to get the broken panel
replaced. Foster had entirely forgotten the
fat, unshaven, untidy man till he heard an
irritated voice behind him say:</p>

<p>“It can’t be April!”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You’re a liar. It’s still March.”</p>

<p>“Oh, take a walk,” said Foster, who was
profoundly shaken, though he did not quite
know why. The obvious reasons for his
nervousness, he suspected, weren’t the real
ones.</p>

<p>“You’re a liar, I said,” the fat man snarled,
breathing heavily in Foster’s face. “It’s
March! You’ll either admit it’s March, or—or—”</p>

<p>But Foster had had enough. He pushed the
fat man away and had taken two steps when
a tingling shock raced through him and the
small, cold, spot of clarity sprang into existence
within his brain.</p>

<p>The juke-box started to play; “Accentuate
the Positive, Eliminate the Negative.”</p>

<p>“It’s March!” the fat man yelped. “Isn’t
it March?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Foster said thickly. “It’s March.”</p>

<p>All that night the song-title blazed in his
mind. He went home with the fat man. He
drank with the fat man. He agreed with the
fat man. He never used a negative. And,
by morning, he was surprised to find that the
fat man had hired him as a song-writer for
Summit Studios, simply because Foster didn’t
say no when he was asked whether he could
write songs.</p>

<p>“Good,” the fat man said. “Now I’d better
get home. Oh, I am home, aren’t I? Well,
I gotta go to the studio tomorrow. We’re
starting a super-musical April second, and—This
is April, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“Let’s get some sleep. No, not that door.
The swimming-pool’s out there. Here, I’ll
show you a spare bedroom. You’re sleepy,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Foster, who wasn’t.</p>

<p>But he slept, nevertheless, and the next
morning found himself at Summit Studios
with the fat man, putting his signature on a
contract. Nobody asked his qualifications.
Taliaferro, the fat man, had okayed him.
That was enough. He was given an office
with a piano and a secretary, and sat dazedly
behind his desk for most of the day, wondering
how the devil it had all happened. At
the commissary, however, he picked up some
scraps of information.</p>

<p>Taliaferro was a big shot—a very big shot.
He had one idiosyncrasy. He couldn’t endure
disagreement. Only yes-men were allowed
around him. Those who worked for Taliaferro
had to accentuate the positive, eliminate
the negative.</p>

<p>Foster got his assignment. A romantic love
song for the new picture. A duet. Everyone
took it for granted that Foster knew one note
from another. He did, having studied piano
in his youth, but counterpoint and the mysteries
of minor keys were far beyond him.</p>

<p>That night he went back to the little
downtown bar.</p>

<p>It was just a hunch, but he thought the
juke-box might be able to help him. Not
that he really believed in such things, but at
worst, he could hoist a few shots and try to
figure a way out. But the juke-box kept
playing one song over and over.</p>

<p>The odd thing was that nobody else heard
that particular song. Foster discovered that
quite by accident. To Austin’s ears, the juke-box
was going through an ordinary repertoire
of modern popular stuff.</p>

<p>After that, Foster listened more closely.
The song was a haunting duet, plaintive and
curiously tender. It had overtones in it that
made Foster’s spine tingle.</p>

<p>“Who wrote that thing?” he asked Austin.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it Hoagy Carmichael?”</p>

<p>But they were talking at cross-purposes.
The juke-box suddenly sang. “I Dood It,”
and then relapsed into the duet.</p>

<p>“No,” Austin said. “I guess it wasn’t Hoagy.
That’s an old one. ‘Dardanella.’ ”</p>

<p>But it wasn’t “Dardanella.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>Foster saw a piano at the back. He
went to it and got out his notebook. First
he wrote the lyrics. Then he tried to get
the notes down, but they were beyond him,
even with the piano as a guide. The best he
could achieve was a sort of shorthand. His
own voice was true and good, and he thought
he might be able to sing the piece accurately,
if he could find someone to put down the
notes for him.</p>

<p>When he finished, he studied the juke-box
more closely. The broken panel had been
repaired. He patted the gadget in a friendly
way and went away thinking hard.</p>

<p>His secretary’s name was Lois Kennedy.
She came into his office the next day while
Foster was tapping at the piano and helplessly
endeavoring to write down the score.</p>

<p>“Let me help you, Mr. Foster,” she said
competently, casting a practised eye over
the messy pages.</p>

<p>“I—no, thanks,” Foster said.</p>

<p>“Are you bad on scores?” she asked as she
smiled. “A lot of composers are that way.
They play by ear, but they don’t know G
sharp from A flat.”</p>

<p>“They don’t, eh?” Foster murmured.</p>

<p>The girl eyed him intently. “Suppose you
run through it, and I’ll mark down a rough
scoring.”</p>

<p>Foster hit a few chords. “Phooey!” he said
at last, and picked up the lyrics. Those were
readable, anyway. He began to hum.</p>

<p>“Swell,” Lois said. “Just sing it. I’ll catch
the melody.”</p>

<p>Foster’s voice was true, and he found it
surprisingly easy to remember the love song
the juke-box had played. He sang it, and
Lois presently played it on the piano, while
Foster corrected and revised. At least he
could tell what was wrong and what was
right. And, since Lois had lived music since
her childhood, she had little difficulty in
recording the song on paper.</p>

<p>Afterwards she was enthusiastic.</p>

<p>“It’s swell,” she said. “Something really
new. Mr. Foster, you’re good. And you’re
not lifting from Mozart, either. I’ll shoot this
right over to the big boy. Usually it’s smart
not to be in too much of a hurry, but since
this is your first job here, we’ll chance it.”</p>

<p>Taliaferro liked the song. He made a few
useless suggestions, which Foster, with Lois’s
aid, incorporated, and sent down a list of
what else was needed for the super-musical.
He also called a conclave of the song-writers
to listen to Foster’s opus.</p>

<p>“I want you to hear what’s good,” Taliaferro
told them. “This new find of mine is
showing you up. I think we need new blood,”
he finished darkly, eying the wretched song-writers
with ominous intensity.</p>

<p>But Foster quaked in his boots. For all he
knew, his song might have been plagiarized.
He expected someone in the audience to
spring up and shout:</p>

<p>“That new find of yours swiped his song
from Berlin!”</p>

<p>Or Gershwin or Porter or Hammerstein,
as the case might be.</p>

<p>Nobody exposed him. The song was new.
It established Foster as a double-threat man,
since he had done both melody and lyrics
himself.</p>

<p>He was a success.</p>

<p>Every night he had his ritual. Alone, he
visited a certain downtown bar. When necessary,
the juke-box helped him with his songs.
It seemed to know exactly what was needed.
It asked little in return. It served him with
the unquestioning fidelity of ‘Cigarette’ in
“Under Two Flags.” And sometimes it played
love songs aimed at Foster’s ears and heart.
It serenaded him. Sometimes, too, Foster
thought he was going crazy.</p>

<p>Weeks passed. Foster got all his assignments
done at the little downtown bar, and
later whipped them into suitable shape with
his secretary’s assistance. He had begun to
notice that she was a strikingly pretty girl,
with attractive eyes and lips. Lois seemed
amenable, but so far Foster had held back
from any definite commitment. He felt unsure
of his new triumphs.</p>

<p>But he blossomed like the rose. His bank
account grew fat, he looked sleeker and
drank much less, and he visited the downtown
bar every night. Once he asked Austin
about it.</p>

<p>“That juke-box. Where’d it come from?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Austin said. “It was here
before I came.”</p>

<p>“Well, who puts new records in it?”</p>

<p>“The company, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Ever see ’em do it?”</p>

<p>Austin thought. “Can’t say I have. I guess
the man comes around when the other bartender’s
on duty. It’s got a new set of records
on every day, though. That’s good service.”</p>

<p>Foster made a note to ask the other bartender
about it. But there was no time. For,
the next day, he kissed Lois Kennedy.</p>

<p>That was a mistake. It was the booster
charge. The next thing Jerry Foster knew,
he was making the rounds with Lois, and it
was after dark, and they were driving unsteadily
along the Sunset Strip, discussing
life and music.</p>

<p>“I’m going places,” Foster said, dodging an
oddly ambulatory telephone pole. “We’re
going places together.”</p>

<p>“Oh, honey!” Lois said.</p>

<p>Foster stopped the car and kissed her.</p>

<p>“That calls for another drink,” he remarked.
“Is that a bar over there?”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>The night wore on. Foster hadn’t realized
he had been under a considerable
strain. Now the lid was off. It was wonderful
to have Lois in his arms, to kiss her, to
feel her hair brushing his cheek. Everything
became rosy.</p>

<p>Through the rosy mist he suddenly saw
the face of Austin.</p>

<p>“The same?” Austin inquired.</p>

<p>Foster blinked. He was sitting in a booth,
with Lois beside him. He had his arm around
the girl, and he had an idea he had just
kissed her.</p>

<p>“Austin,” he said, “how long have we
been here?”</p>

<p>“About an hour. Don’t you remember, Mr.
Foster?”</p>

<p>“Darling,” Lois murmured, leaning heavily
against her escort.</p>

<p>Foster tried to think. It was difficult.</p>

<p>“Lois,” he finally said, “haven’t I got another
song to write?”</p>

<p>“It’ll keep.”</p>

<p>“No. That torch song. Taliaferro wants it
Friday.”</p>

<p>“That’s four days away.”</p>

<p>“Now I’m here, I might as well get the
song,” Foster said, with alcoholic insistence,
and stood up.</p>

<p>“Kiss me,” Lois murmured, leaning toward
him.</p>

<p>He obeyed, though he had a feeling that
there was more important business to be
attended to. Then he stared around, located
the juke-box, and went toward it.</p>

<p>“Hello, there,” he said, patting the sleek,
glowing sides. “I’m back. Drunk, too. But
that’s all right. Let’s have that song.”</p>

<p>The juke-box was silent. Foster felt Lois
touch his arm.</p>

<p>“Come on back. We don’t want music.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, hon.”</p>

<p>Foster stared at the juke-box. Then he
laughed.</p>

<p>“I know,” he said, and pulled out a handful
of change. He slid a nickel into the coin-lever
and pushed the lever hard.</p>

<p>Nothing happened.</p>

<p>“Wonder what’s wrong with it?” Foster
muttered. “I’ll need that song by Friday.”</p>

<p>He decided that there were a lot of things
he didn’t know about, and ought to. The
muteness of the juke-box puzzled him.</p>

<p>All of a sudden he remembered something
that had happened weeks ago, the blond man
who had attacked the juke-box with a
hatchet and had only got shocked for his
pains. The blond man he vaguely recalled,
used to spend hours <i>en tête-à-tête</i> with the
juke-box.</p>

<p>“What a dope!” Foster said thickly.</p>

<p>Lois asked a question.</p>

<p>“I should have checked up before,” he
answered her. “Maybe I can find out—oh,
nothing, Lois. Nothing at all.”</p>

<p>Then he went after Austin. Austin gave
him the blond man’s name and, an hour later,
Foster found himself sitting by a white hospital
bed, looking down at a man’s ravaged
face under faded blond hair. Brashness, judicious
tipping, and a statement that he was a
relative had got him this far. Now he sat
there and watched and felt questions die
as they formed on his lips.</p>

<p>When he finally mentioned the juke-box, it
was easier. He simply sat and listened.</p>

<p>“They carried me out of the bar on a
stretcher,” the blond man said. “Then a car
skidded and came right at me. I didn’t feel
any pain. I still don’t feel anything. The
driver—she said she’d heard somebody
shouting her name. Chloe. That startled her
so much she lost control, and hit me. You
know who yelled ‘Chloe,’ don’t you?”</p>

<p>Foster thought back. There was a memory
somewhere.</p>

<p>The juke-box had begun to play “Chloe,”
and the amplification had gone haywire, so
the song had bellowed out thunderously for
a short time.</p>

<p>“I’m paralyzed,” the blond man said. “I’m
dying, too. I might as well. I think I’ll be
safer. She’s vindictive and plenty smart.”</p>

<p>“She?”</p>

<p>“A spy. Maybe there’s all sorts of gadgets
masquerading as—as things we take for
granted. I don’t know. They substituted
that juke-box for the original one. It’s alive.
No, not it! <i>She!</i> It’s a she, all right!”</p>

<p>And—“Who put her there?” The blond
man said, in answer to Foster’s question.
“Who are—they? People from another world
or another time? Martians? They want information
about us, I’ll bet, but they don’t
dare appear personally. They plant gadgets
that we’ll take for granted, like that juke-box,
to act as spies. Only this one got out
of control a little. She’s smarter than the
others.”</p>

<p>He pushed himself up on the pillow, his
eyes glaring at the little radio beside him.</p>

<p>“Even that!” he whispered. “Is that an
ordinary, regular radio? Or is it one of
their masquerading gadgets, spying on us?”</p>

<p>He fell back.</p>

<p>“I began to understand quite a while ago,”
the man continued weakly. “She put the
ideas in my head. More than once she pulled
me out of a jam. Not now, though. She won’t
forgive me. Oh, she’s feminine, all right.
When I got on her bad side, I was sunk.
She’s smart, for a juke-box. A mechanical
brain? Or—I don’t know.</p>

<p>“I’ll never know, now. I’ll be dead pretty
soon. And that’ll be all right with me.”</p>

<p>The nurse came in then....</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>Jerry Foster was coldly frightened.
And he was drunk. Main Street was
bright and roaring as he walked back, but
by the time he had made up his mind, it
was after closing hour and a chill silence
went hand in hand with the darkness. The
street lights didn’t help much.</p>

<p>“If I were sober I wouldn’t believe this,”
he mused, listening to his hollow footfalls
on the pavement. “But I do believe it. I’ve
got to fix things up with that—juke-box!”</p>

<p>Part of his mind guided him into an alley.
Part of his mind told him to break a window,
muffling the clash with his coat, and the same
urgent, sober part of his mind guided him
through a dark kitchen and a swinging door.</p>

<p>Then he was in the bar. The booths were
vacant. A faint, filtered light crept through
the Venetian blinds shielding the street windows.
Against a wall stood the black, silent
bulk of the juke-box.</p>

<p>Silent and unresponsive. Even when Foster
inserted a nickel, nothing happened. The
electric cord was plugged in the socket, and
he threw the activating switch, but that made
no difference.</p>

<p>“Look,” he said. “I was drunk. Oh, this is
crazy. It can’t be happening. You’re not
alive—<i>Are you alive?</i> Did you put the
finger on that guy I just saw in the hospital?
Listen!”</p>

<p>It was dark and cold. Bottles glimmered
against the mirror behind the bar. Foster
went over and opened one. He poured the
whisky down his throat.</p>

<p>After a while, it didn’t seem so fantastic
for him to be standing there arguing with a
juke-box.</p>

<p>“So you’re feminine,” he said. “I’ll bring
you flowers tomorrow. I’m really beginning
to believe! Of course I believe! I can’t write
songs. Not by myself. You’ve got to help
me. I’ll never look at a—another girl.”</p>

<p>He tilted the bottle again.</p>

<p>“You’re just in the sulks,” he said. “You’ll
come out of it. You love me. You know you
do. This is crazy!”</p>

<p>The bottle had mysteriously vanished. He
went behind the bar to find another. Then,
with a conviction that made him freeze motionless,
he knew that there was someone
else in the room.</p>

<p>He was hidden in the shadows where he
stood. Only his eyes moved as he looked toward
the newcomers. There were two of
them, and they were not human.</p>

<p>They—moved—toward the juke-box, in a
rather indescribable fashion. One of them
pulled out a small, shining cylinder from the
juke-box’s interior.</p>

<p>Foster, sweat drying on his cheeks, could
hear them thinking.</p>

<p>“Current report for the last twenty-four
hours, Earth time. Put in a fresh recording
cylinder. Change the records, too.”</p>

<p>Foster watched them change the records.
Austin had said that the disks were replaced
daily. And the blond man, dying in the hospital,
had said other things. It couldn’t be
real. The creatures he stared at could not
exist. They blurred before his eyes.</p>

<p>“A human is here,” one of them thought.
“He has seen us. We had better eliminate
him.”</p>

<p>The blurry, inhuman figures came toward
him. Foster, trying to scream, dodged around
the end of the bar and ran toward the juke-box.
He threw his arms around its unresponsive
sides and gasped:</p>

<p>“Stop them! Don’t let them kill me!”</p>

<p>He couldn’t see the creatures now but he
knew that they were immediately behind
him. The clarity of panic sharpened his vision.
One title on the juke-box’s list of
records stood out vividly. He thrust his forefinger
against the black button beside the
title “Love Me Forever.”</p>

<p>Something touched his shoulder and tightened,
drawing him back.</p>

<p>Lights flickered within the juke-box. A
record swung out. The needle lowered into
its black groove.</p>

<p>The juke-box started to play “I’ll Be Glad
When You’re Dead, You Rascal You.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
